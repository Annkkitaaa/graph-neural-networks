# Graph Neural Network (GNN) Repository

Welcome to the Graph Neural Network (GNN) Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing Graph Neural Networks, a powerful class of neural networks designed specifically for modeling graph-structured data.

## What is a Graph Neural Network (GNN)?

A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a type of neural network that operates on graph-structured data. Graphs are mathematical structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). GNNs leverage the inherent structure of graphs to learn representations of nodes and edges, enabling powerful machine learning models for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and more.

## Components of Graph Neural Networks:

### 1. Graph Convolutional Layers:
   - Graph convolutional layers are the fundamental building blocks of GNNs. They aggregate information from neighboring nodes in a graph to update the representation of each node.
   
### 2. Message Passing:
   - Message passing is the process by which information is propagated between nodes in a graph. It forms the basis of operations in GNNs, allowing nodes to communicate and exchange information.
   
### 3. Node Embeddings:
   - Node embeddings are low-dimensional vector representations of nodes in a graph. These embeddings capture the structural and relational information of nodes, enabling downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.
   
### 4. Graph Pooling:
   - Graph pooling is the process of downsampling or summarizing the information from a graph. It helps in handling graphs of varying sizes and complexities by reducing computational complexity while preserving important structural information.

### 5. Graph Attention Mechanisms:
   - Graph attention mechanisms enable GNNs to selectively attend to relevant nodes or edges in a graph, enhancing the model's ability to focus on important information during message passing.

### 6. Graph Neural Network Architectures:
   - Various architectures of GNNs have been proposed, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), GraphSAGE, and more. Each architecture has its strengths and is suited to different types of graph-based tasks.
